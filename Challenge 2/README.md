A simple game of tic-tac-toe for 2 players and a 3x3 board to put into practice concepts such as: arrays, functions and classes.
Thanks to the use of classes the program can be modified to accept bigger boards and more players. However, the function that checks if any player has won only works correctly for 3x3 boards and will miss any consecutive rows outside the main two diagonals of the board.
